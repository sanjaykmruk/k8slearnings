# This repo contain my learnings of kubernetes when playing with it.

### You can `exec` container within the pod

- exec to container when there is only one container in the pod

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> /bin/bash
```

- exec to container within pod when you have multiple containers in pod

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -c <container_name> /bin/bash
```

### To install curl using apt-get 

- exec to container

```bash
apt-get upgrade # upgrade the apt-get to latest version and to get apt-get repointed correctly.
apt-get update # it updates the package lists for upgrades
apt-get install curl -y # insatlls curl
```
### You can't change every parametere in your pod yaml file. there are only certain field which can be changed.

```bash
The Pod "command-pod" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: pod updates may not change fields other than `spec.containers[*].image`, `spec.initContainers[*].image`, `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` or `spec.tolerations` (only additions to existing tolerations)
```

### `Kubectl logs` give lot of useful options to view the logs of the the containers inside the pod. Some useful option are:

- Return snapshot logs from pod nginx with multi containers

```bash
  kubectl logs nginx --all-containers=true
```

- Begin streaming the logs of the ruby container in pod web-1
 
```bash
 kubectl logs -f -c ruby web-1
```

- To streaming the logs from all containers in pods defined by label `app=nginx`

```bash
kubectl logs -f -lapp=nginx --all-containers=true
```

### To tell K8s about your `container` not pod `health` you write probes
- readinessProbe: 
     Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed
     from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
  
- livenessProbe: 
     Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the
     probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-pro
bes 

### Three ways to define a probe
#### One and only one of the following should be specified when defining the `Probe`.

- httpGet
- exec
- tcpSocket 

### Security Context can be defined at pod level as well as container level. 

#### container inherit the security context of pod if not defined. If security context is defined at both level then container security context takes precedence.
##### Out of various feilds defined in the security context, below two at most common.

- runAsUser  <integer> : The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified.
- runAsGroup <integer> : The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. 
  
### Label are defined under the metadata tag of a resource in k8s.

#### labels are Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects 

```bash
metadata:
  labels:
    name: my-lable
```
#### Use by match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
